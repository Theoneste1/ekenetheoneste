               Theoneste Nsanzabarinda and Eken, in fullAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
              was born on October 15, 1931, in
              Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
               He served as the 11th President
              of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
               Kalam earned a degree in
              aeronautical engineering from the
              Madras Institute of Technology and in
              1958 joined the Defence Research and
              Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
              In 1969, he moved to the Indian
              Space Research Organisation, where he
              was project director of the SLV-III, the
              first satellite launch vehicle that was
              both designed and produced in India.
              <br>
              <br> Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
              Kalam planned the program that produced
              a number of successful missiles, which
              helped earn him the nickname <strong>
              “Missile Man.”</strong>
              <br>
              <br>  Among those successes
              was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
              ballistic missile, which incorporated
              aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
              in 1989.
